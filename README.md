# refactoring-example
In this task, your key is to modify the code of the application called LegacyApp. You can access its code using this tool. We want the code in the "LegacyAppConsumer" project to remain unchanged. No other code is possible in this solution.
Everything in the LegacyApp project can be modified - as long as it does not change the class interface in the LegacyAppConsumer project. Cannot get different UserDataAccess class and AddUser static methods. It has been written that this class cannot be used in the reason.
